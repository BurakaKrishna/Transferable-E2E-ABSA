# Transferable-E2E-ABSA

## Task Definition
1. E2E-ABSA aims to jointly learn aspects as well as their sentiments from user reviews. This taks can be effectively formulated as an end-to-end manner based on the unified tagging scheme.

The unified tagging is similar to the NER tagging.
### unified tag = aspect boundary tag + sentiment tag
### NER tag     = entity boundary tag + entity type tag



2. Transferable-E2E-ABSA 

and firstly explore an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting for cross-domain E2E-ABSA.


We will release the code and paper soon!
