# Transferable-E2E-ABSA

## Task Definition

**E2E-ABSA**: This task aims to jointly learn aspects as well as their sentiments from user reviews, whch can be effectively formulated as an end-to-end manner based on the unified tagging scheme.

The unified tagging is similar to the NER tagging.
unified tag = aspect boundary tag + sentiment tag
NER tag = entity boundary tag + entity type tag

As we all know, labeling sequence data behaves much more expensive and time-comsuming. 

**Transferable-E2E-ABSA**: we firstly explore an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting for cross-domain E2E-ABSA. Unlike the traditional UDA in classification problems, this task aims to leverage knowledge from a labeled source domain to improve the ***sequence learning*** in an unlabeled target domain.





We will release the code and paper soon!
